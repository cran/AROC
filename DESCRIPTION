Description: Estimates the covariate-adjusted Receiver Operating Characteristic (AROC) curve and pooled (unadjusted) ROC curve by different methods. Inacio de Carvalho, V., and Rodriguez-Alvarez, M. X. (2018) <arXiv:1806.00473>. NOTE: We have created a new package, ROCnReg, with more functionalities. It also implements all the methods included in AROC. We, therefore, recommend using ROCnReg (AROC will no longer be maintained).
